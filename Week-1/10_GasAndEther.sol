How much ether do you need to pay for a transaction?

You pay gas spent * gas price amount of ether, where

    - gas is a unit of computation
    - gas spent is the total amount of gas used in a transaction
    - gas price is how much ether you are willing to pay per gas

    Transactions with higher gas price have higher priority to be included in a block.

    - Unspent gas will be refunded.

    Gas Limit

There are 2 upper bounds to the amount of gas you can spend

    - gas limit (max amount of gas you're willing to use for your transaction, set by you)
    - block gas limit (max amount of gas allowed in a block, set by the network)
